#INSPIRATION üí°‚ú®

We have encountered several instances where we dozed off at parties because of the boredom. The lack of entertainment and interaction is the root cause of it. We wanted to find a way to help keep the organizers worry-free about the entertainment of their guests. So we decided to create an app to add some fun to those boring times.

# WHAT IT DOES üö©‚ú®

1. This app is designed to conduct games best suited for physical meetings. 
2. Helps to increase audience interaction by conducting fun games. Say goodbye to boring 
    meetings. 
3. It provides a variety of fun games and activities. 
4. It can be especially used in ice-breaking sessions

# HOW WE BUILT IT üß±‚ú®

1. HTML and CSS were used in the development of the home page of the web app.
2. Javascript was used along with HTML and CSS for developing games.

# CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO üßó‚ú®

1. Few bugs in the code.
2. Designing the games for the best possible interaction.
3. Developing user-friendly UI/UX.

# ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'RE PROUD OF üèÜ‚ú®

Our app helps to save the environment as well. In most cases, people tend to write the challenge prompts on pieces of paper. With this app, we can skip the task of coming up with ideas and creating a dump of wasted paper.

# WHAT WE LEARNED  üè´‚ú®

We learned a lot participating in this hackathon. We were awed by the support we got from the hackathon community on discord. Out of the zillion things, that we learnt some of them were the following:

1. Time management. 
2. Using GitHub (since some of us were first time hackers).
3. Making a GoDaddy repository. 
4. Integrating APIs.

# WHAT'S NEXT FOR GatherUp üîÆ‚ú®

1. Adding additional and more interactive games.
2. Improving the User Interface.
3. Option to customize games.
